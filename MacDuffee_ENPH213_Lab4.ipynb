    "Write a function $GaussPivot(Ab, col)$ that inputs an augmented matrix $Ab$ of an $N \\times N$ matrix/2D array $A$ and vector/2D array $b$ of the size $N \\times 1$.  The $col$ input to the function is the column that of the pivot element ot be assessed.  For this Part, the goal is to simulate finding those rows that would need to be pivoted in a Gaussian Elimination procedure, and no \"zeroing\" of columns is needed.  Remember that for a generic column $col$ input, a pivot point of $A_{jj}$ means that the pivot row is the same index as the column being reduced and only rows below $A_{jj}$ need to be considered.\n",
