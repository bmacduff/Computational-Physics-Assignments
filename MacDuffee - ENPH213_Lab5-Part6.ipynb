To do this, from your Lab 4 Jupyter notebook, select \"File-->Download as-->Python (.py)\".  Save this file as \"Lab4.py\" in the directory of this notebook.  Then below, add the line \"from Lab4 import BackSub\".  It may load and perform all computations, but you will not have access to your previous functions in this notebook.
